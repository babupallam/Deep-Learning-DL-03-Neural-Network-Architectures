## **Usage**

### **1. Running the Basic CNN Implementation**

You can run the basic CNN model on the **CIFAR-10** dataset by executing the following script:

```bash
python cnn_basic.py
```

This will load the CIFAR-10 dataset, build a simple CNN, train it, and evaluate its performance on the test set.

### **2. Running Experiments with Different Configurations**

The repository includes several scripts for running experiments with varying configurations:
- **cnn_depth_experiment.py**: Explore how increasing the depth of the CNN affects accuracy and overfitting.
- **cnn_filter_experiment.py**: Test different numbers of filters in convolutional layers.
- **cnn_learning_rate_experiment.py**: Experiment with different learning rates and see the impact on training speed and accuracy.
- **cnn_batch_size_experiment.py**: Investigate how batch size influences training efficiency and model performance.

### **3. Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models**

You can experiment with **transfer learning** using pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) by running the following script:

```bash
python transfer_learning.py
```

This script loads pre-trained models from PyTorchâ€™s `torchvision.models` and fine-tunes them on CIFAR-10.
