# **2.1 CNN Foundations (Theory)**

Welcome to the **2.1 CNN Foundations (Theory)** repository! This repository is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of the **theoretical foundations** and **mechanisms** behind **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using hands-on implementation in **Google Colab**. It covers the core components, key concepts, and advanced topics related to CNNs, from convolutional layers to backpropagation and optimization.

## **Overview**

This subrepository explores the **foundations of CNNs** with a strong focus on the **theory** behind how CNNs work. The learning approach is structured to gradually build knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, including:
- Convolution operations
- Feature extraction
- Activation functions
- Pooling layers
- Receptive fields
- Backpropagation
- Optimization techniques

Each concept will be supported by practical **Google Colab** implementations to solidify theoretical understanding.
