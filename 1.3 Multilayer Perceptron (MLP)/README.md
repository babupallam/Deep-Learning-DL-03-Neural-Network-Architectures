### **Introduction**

The **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is a type of neural network with multiple hidden layers, designed to model complex relationships between input and output data. This repository dives into key concepts, including how MLPs evolved from **Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)**, the importance of non-linear activation functions, and how **backpropagation** enables multi-layer training.

Each concept is demonstrated with **code examples and hands-on experiments in Google Colab notebooks**, allowing you to understand and experiment with MLPs in practice.
