        "Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) are typically used for supervised learning tasks where the model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs. However, FFNNs can also be adapted for certain types of unsupervised learning tasks. Hereâ€™s how:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Adaptations of FFNNs for Unsupervised Learning:\n",
        "1. **Autoencoders**:\n",
        "   - **Structure**: An autoencoder is a type of neural network that uses an FFNN structure to learn efficient encodings (compressions) of unlabeled data. The network typically has a symmetrical architecture, with the middle layer representing the encoded (or compressed) version of the input.\n",
        "   - **Function**: The FFNN is trained to reconstruct its own inputs. It compresses (encodes) the input into a smaller dimensional space and then reconstructs (decodes) the output back to the original input dimensions.\n",
        "   - **Objective**: The goal is not to predict a target output but to learn a representation that captures some form of structure or pattern in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clustering with Neural Networks**:\n",
        "   - **Approach**: While less common, some adaptations of FFNNs can perform clustering by learning to group data into clusters based on the network's outputs. These methods might involve specialized layers or loss functions designed to encourage the network to discover groupings in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Using Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection\n",
        "- **Context**: Anomaly detection involves identifying rare items, events, or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.\n",
        "- **How FFNNs Are Used**:\n",
        "  - **Data Compression**: An autoencoder FFNN is trained on a dataset representing normal operations (the majority data). The network learns to compress and then decompress the data with minimal loss.\n",
        "  - **Detection**: When new data is fed into the trained network, data that cannot be reconstructed well (has a high reconstruction error) is likely to be anomalous since the network did not learn its pattern during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example shows that even though FFNNs are inherently suited for supervised tasks, their architecture can be cleverly adapted to perform unsupervised learning tasks like feature extraction and anomaly detection."
