# **7.1 Pix2Pix and CycleGAN (Image-to-Image Translation)**

## **Overview**
This repository provides a comprehensive learning path for **image-to-image translation** using two popular models: **Pix2Pix** and **CycleGAN**. The repository is structured to guide deep research and experimentation on paired and unpaired image translation tasks using **Google Colab** for all implementations. We explore key concepts such as **cyclic consistency loss**, the differences between Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, optimization techniques, and creative applications in fields such as **artistic style transfer** and **object transformation**.
