### How to Integrate this into the README:

You could add a section that describes this taxonomy of deep learning architectures in your repository's `README.md` file. Hereâ€™s an example of how this can be structured:

## Deep Learning Architectures

This repository organizes deep learning architectures into two major categories: **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**. Below is a breakdown of the architectures covered in this repository:

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning models are trained on labeled datasets, which means each training example is paired with an output label. The following supervised learning architectures are included:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** CNNs are primarily used for processing structured grid data, like images. They have been highly successful in the field of computer vision.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** RNNs are used for sequence data, such as time series or natural language. They include specialized types like:
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** LSTM networks address the vanishing gradient problem and are effective in learning long-term dependencies.
  - **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU):** GRUs are a variant of LSTM networks that are simpler and sometimes more effective.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning models are trained on data without labeled responses, making them suitable for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and generation. The unsupervised learning architectures covered include:

- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM):** SOMs are used for visualization and clustering of high-dimensional data.
- **Autoencoders:** Autoencoders are neural networks used to learn efficient codings of input data. Variants of autoencoders include:
  - **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM):** RBMs are stochastic neural networks used as building blocks for deep belief networks (DBNs).
