## **Key Observations**

- **DCGANs** leverage convolutional layers to produce more realistic images, especially for datasets like **CelebA**. They benefit from **batch normalization** and **ReLU activations** to stabilize training.
- **WGANs** improve on traditional GANs by using the **Wasserstein loss** function, which mitigates mode collapse and provides more stable training. **WGAN-GP** further improves stability by introducing a **gradient penalty**.
- Both **latent space dimensionality** and **learning rates** significantly affect the diversity of generated images. Proper tuning is essential for achieving both stability and high-quality outputs.
- **Computational challenges** arise when scaling GANs to larger datasets, but techniques like **gradient penalty** and **parallelization** can mitigate these issues.
