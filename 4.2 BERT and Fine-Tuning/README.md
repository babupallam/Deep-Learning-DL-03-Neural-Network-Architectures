# **4.2 BERT and Fine-Tuning - README**

This repository contains all the materials and code for the **"4.2 BERT and Fine-Tuning"** learning strategy, focusing on **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and its **fine-tuning** for various NLP tasks. The project is structured according to a well-organized learning path, starting from the fundamental concepts of BERT to advanced topics such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and handling specific challenges like sentiment ambiguity and small datasets.

All the experiments and implementations are performed using **Google Colab** for ease of access and GPU/TPU support. This README will guide you through the contents of the repository, following the same structure as the learning strategy outline.
