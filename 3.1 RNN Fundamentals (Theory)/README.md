# **3.1 RNN Fundamentals (Theory) - README**

Welcome to the **3.1 RNN Fundamentals (Theory)** repository! This repository contains a well-organized learning strategy for mastering **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, including fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and key observations. The goal of this project is to provide both theoretical knowledge and hands-on coding exercises to help you understand and experiment with RNNs.

All implementations and exercises are designed to be run in **Google Colab**, taking advantage of its free GPU support and collaborative features.
